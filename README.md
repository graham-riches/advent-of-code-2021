# Introduction
This repo can be used by anyone in the company to track their code and solutions for Advent of Code 2021. 

The main branch is locked, so only admins should ever be able to push changes to it.

# Getting Started
This repo has a basic branch policy set up such that users can only create branches under the `users` folder. 

However, to keep things organized, please make sure that your branches are all put in the following format: `users/Firstname_Lastname/Branch_Name`.

For example: `users/Mesa_Komarevich/MyCoolBranch`.

Branches will be renamed or moved if they are not created in this format.

You should also all have the ability to lock any branches that you create, which will prevent anyone else from accidentally pushing commits to it, and I suggest that you all do so.
